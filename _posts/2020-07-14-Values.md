title: "Choosing Values"
---
# Background

This topic came up with a discussion between myself and a fellow student. I was asked: 

> Do you have explicitly set values?

At first, this seems like a non-sensical question -- of course everyone has values, whether good or bad. But that is not what this question is asking. It is asking whether or not, we have values which are based upon an explicit logical framework. Is there a reason behind the values or do we have them because they are the *right* values to have.

Now in disecting this questions, I think there are two major pathways in which one can explicitly set values. One could either have a view of what the objective truth of reality is and then they must have values in line with that , e.g. holding some view about salvation for example. The other pathway is that one should choose values based on what one thinks is *right* morally and then derives their objective reality model off those core values.

I will speak about the first pathway and supporting methods for walking this path. Afterwards, I will proceed to discuss the second method. In full disclosure, my model is that of the first, with some caveats, so the second method will be sparse and conjecture. 

# The two paths

## Modeling Objective Reality


**How to model objective reality**

## Modeling values

If we are first to choose values, we must ask: how?

1. How can we choose values?
- The trivial answer is to say that we choose *important* topics and then choose viewpoints on those. From there we may derive overall principles that are laid out 


## Criticisms

A perceived flaw in the first approach is that one must conjecture about objective reality or have some inkling about it from experience. Indeed, if this is done incorrectly, one will just end up following some philosophical approach that sounds "good" to oneself. Now, what is the problem with just choosing what sounds correct, in both this case and in the choosing values case? 

Although typically in modern society we believe that we are not influenced by philosophies of the past, we can see throughout history and our cultural practices of today that we are greatly influenced by past philosophers. For instance, the influence of the German Romantics can be seen in the general teaching of Eastern religious traditions to Westerners [^1]. If one is to accept this, then we must say that in choose what sounds right, we are only choosing what falls in line with whatever philosophy is popular in that era. So in this way, one is not clarifying objective reality, but one is just clarifying the underlying assumptions they hold. This is good in-and-of itself, but it is not the point of this discussion



### Working with Critisms


# Conclusions

In order to be rigorous and concrete in what assumptions are being made, we must choose to develop values by means of attempting to see objective reality and walk in lines with what we perceive as the truth. Else, we may fall into traps of doing what is perceived to be *right*, which may only be defined by philsophical trends of the era. In terms of seeing reality, we must see it in terms of some factor, for Buddhists this is in terms of the three characteristics, *tilakkhaá¹‡a*, and for Abrahamic religions it may be in terms of seeing God.

The key problem with this approach is that we must try to see reality as clearly as possible and there is room for mistake. In the attempts of seeing reality, we are actually developing our own philosophical model and choosing values that fall in line with that model. The benefit is that there is a constant feedback loop. In the Buddhist example, if one chooses a value that causes more stress and suffering (*dukkha*) then one knows that their view of reality is off in some manner. This method proves to be greatly more effort and includes many trials-and-tribulations, but in the end it results in a philosophical model and a set of values completely inline with what is seen by oneself.
