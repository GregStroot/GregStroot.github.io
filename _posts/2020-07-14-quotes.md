# Philosophy

> Now since we are seekign the principles and the highest causes [or grounds], it is clear that these must belong to some *phusis* in virtue of itself. If, then, those who were seeking the elements of being were also seeking these principles, these elements too must be elements of being, not accidentally, but as being. Accordingly, it is of being as being that we, too, must find the first causes." - *Metaphysics*, Aristotle

> "Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful. " - George E.P. Box
