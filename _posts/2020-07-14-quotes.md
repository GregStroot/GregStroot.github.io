# Background

A list of quotes that I found inspiring or I plan to use in future lists.


# Dhamma

# Philosophy

> Now since we are seekign the principles and the highest causes [or grounds], it is clear that these must belong to some *phusis* in virtue of itself. If, then, those who were seeking the elements of being were also seeking these principles, these elements too must be elements of being, not accidentally, but as being. Accordingly, it is of being as being that we, too, must find the first causes." - *Metaphysics*, Aristotle

> "Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful. " - George E.P. Box

# Art

> I wanted very much to learn to draw, for a reason that I kept to myself: I wanted to convey an emotion I have about the beauty of the world. It’s difficult to describe because it’s an emotion. … It’s a feeling of awe — of scientific awe — which I felt could be communicated through a drawing to someone who had also had that emotion. I could remind him, for a moment, of this feeling about the glories of the universe.” — Feynman discussing the intersection of art and science. - Feynman
