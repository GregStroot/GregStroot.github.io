title: "Phenomenon Itself"
---

Recently I began watching "Westworld". Therein, human-like conciousness is created by humans. In the show, we then proceed to follow these artificial humans in their downward spiral of existential crisis. After standing up from watching the show, I felt weird -- well weird isn't the exact right word. I felt like I was watching a movie or like I was a robot, but that's a perception *sanna*. I was watching actions happening to a body that was not my own, but that is really the truth isn't it. This is what is meant by:

> Rūpaṁ anattā

I believe this perception is what the *Buddha* is pointing at. We humans (and beings in general) go throughout our life thinking that being is one continual chain, that there is an overarching theme or progression, but that isn't right. If we can closely watch the mind, you can see that all it is is phenomenon rising following the causal chain to another phenomenon from rising -- this is what *paticcasamutapada* (dependent origination) entails. In the daily chants, there are two deeply profound truths:

> Sabbe dhammā anattāti

All phenomenon are impermanent.

> Sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā

All phenomenon are not-self.

In watching the mind and maintaining the continuity of the mind, we begin to see *samsara* in action. We begin to see the small (and large) scales of dependent origination in action. In this way, we are freed from mental affluents -- free ourselves from suffering. There is some truth to aritificial intelligence in *Westworld* --  we are all stuck in our little loops, AI and human alike. If we can see this once, we must protect that truth and strive to act in like with the *dhamma*, the teachings and the truth. The only way to fully realize the truth, the *dhamma*, is to practice this path. We are so incredibly fortunate to have been born in a human realm -- that is a realm where there is some pleasure and some pain. Moreover, we were born in a time when a *Buddha* has been born. We have a clearly laid out path of practice and the means to practice. These conditions may not arise again for a long-time. We must hold on to this sense of *samvega* and use this to drive our practice.

Finally, let us recall the ending to our daily chants:

> Te (WOMEN: Tā ) mayaṁ,
>  
> Otiṇṇāmha jātiyā jarā-maraṇena,
>  
> Sokehi paridevehi dukkhehi domanassehi upāyāsehi,
> 
> Dukkh’otiṇṇā dukkha-paretā
>
> “Appeva nām’imassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa antakiriyā paññāyethāti!”

All of us, beset by birth, aging, & death, by sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, & despairs, beset by stress, overcome with stress. O, that the end of stress may be known.

May this practice bring about the end of all suffering. May this practice lead all beings to the ending of the suffering. May we all watch the mind and see phenomenon as phenomenon.
