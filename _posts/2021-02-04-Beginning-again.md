title: "Beginning again"
---

In our daily lives, we have peaks and valleys. Periods of intense grief and intense joy. In the same way, many of us experience the same when walking the path to purification -- periods of intense practice and periods where practice falls "behind". In the past few months, I have been in a lull of practice. I have spent the past five months staying with my family and other families. This is contrasted with being at my own apartment, where I have an altar and may chant everyday to my hearts content. Since then, I moved into an apartment with my girlfriend, but I still am not at my apartment and I do not have an altar. Thus, there is more quiet time here, but I am not in my "ideal" setting for practice. Now that I am away from the hectic life of living with many others, I have started to look at the Dhamma again and consider why I fell out of the depths and how to go back into my practice.

Simply put, I let the mind proliferate and keep proliferating and that is what led to my mind spirallying away from the Dhamma. This is perfectly exemplified by the *Kammatthana Yantra* seen in the image above. The line represents a person walking the path and it spirals and spins all around until one is independent in the Dhamma.

I was lost because I never stopped to watch the mind, but simply got caught in the currents. I found myself tense and stressed a lot, I was not reading the Dhamma, and I was not thinking about the Dhamma. "Of course I wasn't because I didn't have time," I thought, which I notice now is a flashing sign that one absolutely must practice. So that leads us to the primary question that we would like to address today:

> How may we restart our practice after a period of inactivity? 

For this, I will reference my own practice, various Suttas, and *The Sound of Silence* by Ajahn Sumedho [^1]. I found there are three inhibitors for "restarting" the practice:

1. Trying to go back to old methods, from when one was entrenched in the Dhamma
- This is much like when a weightlifter goes back and tries to start at very heavy weights again 
2. Not reading the Dhamma
- This is much like when a weightlifter, having forgot how to lift, tries to lift without remembering the proper form. 
3. Not spending time in silence
- This is much like when a weightlifter does not even go to the gym

# Moving back to old methods

This is non-intuitive and something that certainly has inhibited my return to practice. In fact, it inhibited me for months, while I was in others homes. When I would try to practice with other distractors or try to practice in general after a break, I would immediately try to follow my breath, as I had always done. Now this may be good, when one has practiced a lot, but when one hasn't the breathe is much too fine of a motion for the mind to keep track of. It allows one to be quickly lost. I found that I would keep following the breath for one minute and then realize hours later my mind was off proliferating again. So how do we overcome this? How may we get back to the level of concentraction we were once at? Ajahn Sumedho puts this very well:
