# Uposatha

Today is Uposatha, wherein many Theravada Buddhists will observe the eight precepts and commit more of their day to their practice of observing phenomenon. Today my mind was not having it. It kept wanting other sense-pleasures. I had a practice qualifying exam and at first that was my reason for slacking a bit. But even then, my mind was just looking for a different experience -- it was looking for happiness in conditioned phenomenon.

Put in that way it seems esoteric and something that we should really *philsophize* about, but that's not it. Simply put, my mind is looking for happiness in places where it won't find unending happiness. It will only find momentary "happiness" only for it to dissolve, anicca in action. Even in giving into the pleasure, I saw that my mind just wanted some happiness, but upon reflecting I saw that this wasn't the end. Even if I "give in" to the habit, it is not the end. It doesn **NOT** end. That is the very nature *samsara*. Right when the mind is pleased and obtains one pleasurable experience, it is onto the next. Over and over. *Samsara* acts on different time-scales. It can be seen in terms of rebirth, but it may also be seen in terms of our own thought patterns. 

So what can we do? It's a predicament. We can see that to continually give into the mind is a futile exercise, if we ever seek true happiness -- unending happiness. But the mind doesn't want that. It leads a fundamental question:

> How can we turn the mind towards practice?

Thanissaro has talked on this a great deal and I think he speaks of it in a fashion that makes the most sense to me. We must find pleasure in the practice, but a pleasure derived from good actions. We must find pleasure in settling the mind in the mind. Moreover, we must see the dukkha that is incured from the *samsaric* process. Just as we have discussed.

Though I have given into the pleasure this time, I can see it more clearly for what it is. The mind is no different. It is a little calmer, from receiving it's dose of pleasure, but the condition of the mind is no different. It still wants to drink the three poisons and that will not change unless we contemplate and watch phenomenona, as we are interacting with them. Peace truly is the only way out of this whole mess of stress and suffering. Any other way is doomed to fail.


May you be safe. May you be happy. May you swiftly realize peace.
