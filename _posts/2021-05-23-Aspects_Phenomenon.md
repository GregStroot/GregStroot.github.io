# Characteristics of Phenomenon

Mindfulness, *sati*,  is a word that has become bastardized in Western culture. At it's core, it can best be translated as "keeping something in mind". Now, as with all things in Buddhism, there are various levels and perspectives to understand this from. Today, we will explore how "keeping something in mind" functions in the intersection of meditation and daily life.

Following typical meditation instruction, one would be mindful of the breath (*Anapanasati*). In following the breath, we set an anchor point to watch the mind. Some authors have compared this to sitting by a water source to watch wildlife. Indeed, this is a wonderful analogy. In meditation, what we are truly interested in is understanding the patterns of conditionality of the mind -- how the mind follows patterns leading to *dukkha*. Thus, we watch the breathe, where all other patterns will manifest. E.g. when one is upset, the breath will constrict, speed up, or follow some other pattern. If one is mindful of the breath, they will be able to realize that something has gone awry (if they do not first feel the other physical sensations of being upset). Here, we are primarily looking for how the thought world effects the breath (or at least this has been my approach).

This leads a question:

> What are the different ways of seeing phenomenon?

This points is well exponded on in the suttas and I will reference a discussion by *Mahasi Sayadaw*. Ultimately real phenomenon are made up of nothing than the aspects of:

1. characteristics (*lakkhana*)
2. function (*rasa*)
3. manifestation (*paccupatthana*)
4. proximate cause (*padatthana*)

*Mahasi Sayadaw* gives a wonderful example of this. 

> For example, if you note an unpleasant feeling, you can understand its characteristic (unpleasantness), its function (stress), its manifestation (discomfort), or its proximate cause (contact between the mind and an unpleasant object) - Manual of Insight Ch4

Now that we understand what these different ways of viewing a phenomenon on, we may combine this with a mindfulness practice to ground what the mind is watching. As I've begun my formal sitting practice again and have begun to see glimpses of mindfulness in my daily life, this has become particularily important. When one is going about their day, it is very easy to have a glimpse of seeing reality (in that we aren't stuck in a cycle conditioned purely by *kamma*) but then immediately become lost in the sense world again. How may we prevent this? I think the above framework is exactly the answer.

What I have found most helpful is to ground myself in watching the manifestation of the phenomenon -- where do I feel the manifestation in my body, what are the characteristics of it, how does it move. For example, the other day I was in the Home Depot parking lot and a car cut in front of our car. My anger boiled and I shot daggers at the driver, in hopes of causing that driver some pain, so they would learn (or so I thought at the time). From the outside, this is a wholly unsatisfactory response, but this is not easy to see in the moment. As I was shooting daggers at the fellow, that cut in front of us, I felt the manifestation of that anger and I was able to catch *samsara* in action. That anger manifested as a tightness in my chest and in face, a burning and tightening. At that moment, I relaxed those points of tension and realized how caught up the mind was in the cycle of suffering. So, what we found is that by observing certain aspects of phenomenon in meditation, for me it was manifestation, we are able to catch these same phenomenon in our daily life. 

So, the goal of meditation is not just to concentrate during that formal sitting time, but to instill habits of watching phenomenon as phenomenon. This can best be done by considering the four aspects of phenomenon and finding the aspect of phenomenon, that is most visible to oneself. In finding that most visible aspect, one can begin to understand that patterns of the aspect and find locations to watch. Again, in my case that aspect is manifestation and I feel it particularily in my face and chest. Thus, when I go throughout my day, I try to "check up" on these locations in my body. We can gleen a lot of information about where the mind is at, by simply looking in these locations.
