title: "Vim Resources"
---
An overview of my vimrc file. We will attempt to explain basic points of vimscript and go from there. This resource is by no means comprehensive and is meant to only be a reference for myself to look back at.

The main resources we have used here are [Learn Vimscript the Hard Way](https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/) and [Practical Vim: Edit Text at the Speed of Thought](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Vim-Thought-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356980). Further, we have based our vimrc and have gained much insight from [Luke Smiths github](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz).

# Useful Commands

'gi'  Insert at the last edit location
'g;'  Go to last edit location. This can be used multiple times.
'q\*'  Record a macro to key \*. Finish recording by pressing q.
'@\*'  Use macro after recording. Can be used multiple times via 'n@\*'
'.'   Repeat last command block. To use this effectively, one must start thinking with "packets" of work -- an essential part of Vim.

# Vim RC

First we install our plugin manager:

  if ! filereadable(system('echo -n "${XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/nvim/autoload/plug.vim"'))
	    echo "Downloading junegunn/vim-plug to manage plugins..."
	    silent !mkdir -p ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/nvim/autoload/
	    silent !curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim" > ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/nvim/autoload/plug.vim
	    autocmd VimEnter * PlugInstall
  endif

First we check whether or not vim\_plug is installed. If not installed, then we create a directory and we download the plugin from junegunn's git. Further, the commands 'silent' simply silents the output of a bash command. The last line 'autocmd VimEnter ...' is a [Vim command](https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/12.html). What this is saying is that when the VimEnter, e.g. when after all the startup events are finished, event is reached then we run PlugInstall on the pattern \*, which is a wild-card.


# Final Remarks

This is a sparse representation of my working Vim knowledge. I am writing it when I feel motivation and the time. I will attempt to not repeat discussion found elsewhere here, e.g. those found in the preliminary resources. I will only put tidbits here when I believe it to be a useful condensation of knowledge.
