# Note 

This is very much so a work in progress and will be continually updated as my understanding deepens.

# Outline

First, we start with a review of pertient background material the primary reference being [^1]. We will overview the resolvent analysis from the perspective of [^1] and then proceedwith the development of the resolvent analysis as presented in [^2].

# Preliminaries

## Pseudospectral Analysis

While we will be using [^1] as a primary reference, one is encouraged to explore [^3] for a more careful treatement of pseudospectra.

**Follow the motivation from [^3]. Motivate why we care about nonnormal operators**

When extending a theoretical tool, one must first ask: Why? Is there a necessary gap that this new theory fills? In the case of pseudospectral analysis, we are attempting to attack problems where spectral analysis fails, such as the analysis of non-normal operators. 

**Definition of normal and non-normal.**

**Why spectral analysis fails for non-normal.**

**What is the pseudospectrum and why does it work.**


This is all fine and good, but why do we care? It turns out that most fluid systems linearized about spatially nonuniform flows give rise to non-normal operators. Therefore, we must work with pseudospectral analysis if we intend to talk about some for of the "spectrum" within fluid flows. We now move on to how we will use the pseudospectrum in our analysis.


## Resolvent Analysis

**Include Definition of Resolvent from [^3]**

The resolvent (in Fluid Mechanics) is defined as the linear operator relating the input forcing (of a linear operator) to the output. For instance in the incompressible Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations, the output is a divergence-free velocity field and the input to the resolvent are the nonlinear terms of the equation, where the divergence free condition, $$ \nable \dot u = 0 $$ results from incompressiblity. In general, inputs may include general forcing terms and the output may be any observable. Unlike many other analysis methods, this analysis does **not** assume small pertubations, nor does it directly linearize the equations. This allows for a much more general analysis than other approaches afford.

**Talk about importance of the pesudospectral aspect of the resolvent analysis. Allows for analysis of nonnormal analysis, which are normal (haha) in fluid mechanics.**



# Development of the Resolvent analysis [^2]


The paper by McKeon & Sharma [^2] represents one of the foundational papers in applying the resolvent analysis to problems in fluid mechanics, as such it is of utmost importance to understand their formulation.
