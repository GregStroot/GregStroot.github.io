title: "A critical layer model for turbulent pipe flow by Mckeon & Sharma"
---
# Note 

This is very much so a work in progress and will be continually updated as my understanding deepens.

# Outline

First, we start with a review of pertient background material the primary reference being [^1]. We will overview the resolvent analysis from the perspective of [^1] and then proceedwith the development of the resolvent analysis as presented in [^2].

# Preliminaries

## Pseudospectral Analysis

While we will be using [^1] as a primary reference, one is encouraged to explore [^3] for a more careful treatement of pseudospectra.


## Resolvent Analysis
$$

\begin{align}

\phi = \psi * \eta

\end{align}
