This book is still being read and this overview is going to be continually expanded.

# Background

An overview of *Buddhist Romanticism* by Thanissaro Bhikku. I will include quotes and key takeaways with my analysis and expansion.

# Dramatis Personae

## The Buddha

To attempt to succintly describe the Buddha and his life is sure to fail, for the Buddhas life and the philosophical system that he *discovered* is deep and far-reaching. Instead, I will include a few quotes in which the young bodhisatta was struck by the overwhelming pointlessness of *saṃsāra* and what this led him to follow.

> 	I will tell of how
> 	I experienced
> 	dismay.
> Seeing people floundering
> like fish in small puddles,
> competing with one another—
> 	as I saw this,
> 	fear came into me.
> The world was entirely
> 	without substance.
> All the directions
> 	were knocked out of line.
> Wanting a haven for myself,
> I saw nothing that wasn’t laid claim to.
> Seeing nothing in the end
> but competition,
> I felt discontent. — Sn 4:15

In being discontented with the world and seeing how the phenomenal world ran, the Buddha did not claim to be different or not subject to aging, illness, and death. Instead, he sought to find something that did not age, grow ill, or die -- *nibbāna* [^1].

> “And which is the noble search? There is the case where a person, himself being subject to birth, seeing the drawbacks of birth, seeks the unborn, unexcelled rest from the yoke: unbinding (nibbāna). Himself being subject to aging… illness… death… sorrow… defilement, seeing the drawbacks of aging… illness… death… sorrow… defilement, seeks the aging-less, illness-less, deathless, sorrow-less, undefiled, unexcelled rest from the yoke: unbinding. This is the noble search.” — MN 26

This search for awakening is what started the Buddhas journey. The rest of the teachings and stories are left for another time.


## Early Romantics

> Unlike the Buddha, who taught religion as a matter of skill—the skill of finding a lasting and blameless happiness—all five of these Romantic thinkers taught religion as a matter of aesthetics. In the language of their time, this meant two things: (1) that religion dealt with feelings and direct experiences, rather than reason; and (2) that it was an art. In line with their personal views on art, religion-as-art had to be expressive. In other words, religious ideas cannot describe the way things are. Instead, they can only express the feelings of the individual who has a religious experience.
> 
> Their position on this issue, of course, contains a paradox: It describes how religion has to act, while at the same time saying that descriptions about religion are not genuine. In Chapters Four through Seven we will explore this paradox and its long-term effects.
> 
> Here, however, we will take the Romantics’ position at face value and ask a question that grows from placing it against their life stories: Given their view that religion must grow from a direct experience, on what sort of direct experiences did they base their religious views?
>
> In general terms, their answer in every case would be that religion grew from an experience of Oneness with the infinite organic unity of the universe. For them, this experience lay at the basis of all religion.

> Schleiermacher is the only one of the five to recommend specific meditative reflections for inducing a feeling of Oneness, reflections that were primarily exercises of the imagination. 


> “Whose heart does not leap with joy,” cried the youth with glittering eye, “when the innermost life of nature invades him in all its fullness! When the overpowering emotion for which language has no other name than love, expands within him like an all-dissolving vapor and, trembling with sweet fear, he sinks into the dark, alluring heart of nature, consumes his poor personality in the crashing waves of lust, and nothing remains but a focus of infinite procreative force, a yawning vortex in an immense ocean? What is the flame that is manifested everywhere? A fervent embrace, whose sweet fruits fall like sensuous dew. Water, first-born child of airy fusions, cannot deny its voluptuous origin and reveals itself an element of love, and of its mixture with divine omnipotence on earth. Not without truth have ancient sages sought the origin of things in water, and indeed, they spoke of a water more exalted than sea and well water. A water in which only primal fluidity is manifested, as it is manifested in liquid metal; therefore should men revere it always as divine. How few up to now have immersed themselves in the mysteries of fluidity, and there are some in whose drunken soul this surmise of the highest enjoyment and the highest life has never wakened. In thirst this world soul is revealed, this immense longing for liquefaction.” [^2]


> Three, they offered no test for what counts as a genuine religious experience. One of the paradoxes of a felt sense of Oneness with the universe is that when an individual person feels it, no one else in the universe can feel that individual’s experience. A feeling of Oneness is not truly shared. Thus there is no external measure for judging whether the feeling is genuine, or if it actually proves that the universe is One. What is needed is an internal measure—a series of guidelines for the person experiencing the feeling so that he or she can test, from inside, whether the feeling of Oneness is really and fully One. But because the Romantics simply accepted the truth of their feelings without testing them, they were able to offer no test to anyone else.


> • The second point of difference concerns the definition of what is noble in life, and the duties that nobility entails. For the Buddha, spiritual nobility consisted of the search for a happiness that is deathless, a happiness that was not only lasting but also blameless in that—because it depended on no conditions—it placed no burden or hardship on anything or anyone at all. The duty following on this principle was that the path of practice leading to true happiness had to be harmless to all beings as well. The principle of harmlessness carried further a principle of honor: that one would be ashamed to pursue, for the sake of one’s pleasure, any action that would cause others harm. In other words, there were times when it would be necessary to sacrifice one’s feelings for the sake of one’s duty.

> For the Romantics, however, spiritual nobility lay in attaining an authentic feeling of Oneness with the divine. Even though, in their experience, this feeling was only temporary, it had intrinsic worth—so much worth, they felt, that they need not concern themselves if their pursuit of that feeling harmed other people.

> Novalis, perhaps because his bureaucratic career brought him into constant contact with many philistines, strongly defended the superiority of people who were authentic—those who could romanticize their experience and see the infinite within the finite. Thus authentic people were of more account than philistines, who by definition were not authentic; and the feelings of the authentic—because they were more sensitive—mattered more. They, in his eyes, were the natural aristocracy.

What is the relation between *authenticity* and the construction of values? Does *authenticity* lead to the "divine"?

# The *Dhamma* and Romantic teachings










[1]: We note that nibbāna is often translated as the deathless and many other such names. As one reads more and understands, the different analogies start to make sense. The purpose in using different words is to point after different aspects of an ineffable. This relates back to the quote by Wittengenstein on the about page.
