#About and Purpose

My name is Greg Stroot, as of 2019 I am a 1st year PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at California Institute of Technology. I am working with Professor Bevereley Mckeon in the [Mckeon Research Group](https://www.mckeon.caltech.edu/). On an academic level, I study turbulent flows and specifically studying wall-bounded turbulence through the lense of the Resolvent operator.

The intention of this website is to give a glimpse within my mind and to provide a place for myself to index my knowledge for all to see. The primary goal is to share what I'm reading academically, but I intend to write about metaphysics, hermenutics, and ontology. Research may come first and foremost when speaking on a "*practical*" level, but surely philosophy and the practice of such reigns supreme in any other discussion of priorities. While it is interesting to speak of philosophy and any other topic, it is best to temper oneself with the following quote:
> Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent. 
>
> Ludwig Wittengenstein, *Tractus Logico-Philosophicus* [^1]

# Pondering Infinites

The name of this website is inspired by Cantor.
