# Note 

These are reflections and notes for myself on a Dhamma talk written by Thanissaro Bhikku. In sharing these, I hope that others may see that others are not infallible and others are attempting to walk a path to purification (*visuddhimagga*).

Herein I will include a quote and then in *italics* my thought process with relation to it. Below that question, I put my current thoughts and struggles with the problems.

# The Four Nutriments of Life

> All beings subsist on nutriment
> AN 10.27

Now there are the obvious nutriments of food, water, and warmth, but the *Buddha* is not pointing only at edible food. Here-in the Buddha is referring to food for the mind: sense-impression, volitions, and conciousness. Just as the body constantly craves for nutriment, from birth until death, the mind also craves for the nutriment constantly. This is not something that can just be ignored or stopped immediately (for most).  Instead, we must find skill in means (*upaya-kaushalya*) for feeding the mind. In that we should feed the mind in such a way that it leads to the slowing of the need to feed or even the cessation of the need to feed. By slowing the need to feed, we lessen our dependence on outside phenomenon for happiness and are able to ease our stress and suffering from phenomenon. In the follow discussion, we consider how we feed in our daily life and how we may have *upaya-kaushalya*. For a more thorough treatment of this topic please see [^1].

# The Skill of Restraint by Thanissaro Bhikku [^1]

> People often ask how to bring the practice into daily life. The answer is relatively simple. It’s one many people don’t like to hear, but it is simple: restraint. There are basically two kinds of restraint. There’s restraint in what you do, and restraint in how you look and listen and smell and taste and feel and think about things—in other words, restraint in what goes out, and restraint in what comes in. And both kinds of restraint require a good amount of skill. 
> ...
> Try to notice when you look at something: Does your attention go flowing out? Do you lose your sense of the body? If you do, it’s a sign that your looking isn’t all that skillful. You want to be able to stay in the body as you look, as you listen, to maintain your sense of the breath energy throughout the body. If you can’t, that’s a sign either that you’re looking for the purpose of forgetting the body—in other words, you’re looking for the purpose of greed, anger, or delusion—or you’re simply careless, and the sight, the sound, the smell, or the taste, whatever, happened to catch you off guard.

*How does this relate to your daily life?*
*How do you relate to greed, anger, and delusion in the mind?*

I feel as though I know the principle that Thanissaro is discussing, but I typically do not do it. After meditation practice, I try to hold to the inner-awareness, but eventually I slip away. Throughout the years, I've found that the time I am able to be aware is longer and longer, but I am not perfect. What has changed is that I am able to see the stress more. When I meditate, I can see the arising and falling of stress related to mental formations(*Saṅkhāra*).

When I am consuming media or I am procrasting my work, I notice that I try to avoid my awareness of the lust. I know it is there, but I do not want to face it. It is as if I have an aversion to the practice in some sense. I think this is because it is easier, or seems easier, to just keep getting my small hits of dopamine from whatever video I am watching. However, the times I have faced it, I've been rewarded with a greater pleasure. So the question moving forward is:

Why are we not practicting awareness when we see greed, anger, or delusion?

> That’s how most people look and listen and smell and taste and feel and think about things [in an unskillful way]. They forget their inner center and suddenly find themselves centered outside, trying to get some pleasure from grabbing onto a sight or a sound and then elaborating on it—**either to make it more attractive or to make it seem more meaningful than it actually is**. If the mind is in a mood for a little bit of anger, you focus on the things that would provoke the anger and then you can elaborate on it, proliferate as much as you like.

*In our daily life, what do we do this with?*

Just like I discussed, my mind also like to do this, when I'm not aware. In the quote, I highlighted one portion that I wanted to well highlight. I find that in my mind and maybe many Western minds, we like to make things more attractive than they are with relation to insights. I will think about how great my insight is or how great I'm doing in research or swimming or anything that I do. Letting this mind-state flow is a certain way to suffer. When I see this mind-state, I try to return to my awareness, but these defilement-laden thought-loops do not like to go away so easily. So I keep working. 

The key here is to find how we are doing this in our daily lives and guard our mind against them. It is like fixing any bad habit -- looking at your phone when there is a second of intermittency. We must be convinced in the outcome and why we need to break the habit and then we must watch. Please contemplate how these states arise in your own mind, for the well-being of yourself and all living beings.

> The Buddha counts sensory input among the four foods for consciousness. It actually includes three of the four: contact at the senses; intentions at the senses—why you’re looking at these things, listening to these things to begin with; and then consciousness of the act of sensing. These three aspects of sensory input are what the mind is feeding on all the time.

This further expands on what was discussed in the previous section. In almost every moment, we are constantly feeding and specifically through the three aspects mentioned above. At the beginning, it seems that contact, the intention, and the listening at the sensing are all the same, but in time these moments begin to differentiate themselves. This is the motivation for concentation practice, as this allows one to fine-tune their watching of the mind. Further, this motivates mindfulness and ardency. Without mindfulness, one would not remember to watch how we are feeding on sense-pleasures. Without ardency, we would not come back to the senses and would be lost in a world external from ourselves. 

In fact, losing ourselves in the external is the primary mode of operation for many people and many meditators when not meditating. Many times this is fine, in that we get our sense-pleasures and move on, but many other times we do not get what we are looking for. We do not get pleasure from everything and so then the mind likes to blame someone or find someway to soothe its pains. Thus, we must be careful when the mind goes into external worlds. There are dangers when we do not watch the mind. Not watching allows the stress and suffering to further perpetuate itself.

In my own practice, I find that this happens often. I will slip in-and-out of awareness during the day, but I come back to awareness when my mind realizes a defilement has slipped into the mind-stream. This is why we practice. Eventually, the queues for my mind to stay into awareness will be constant and we won't slip out of awareness. We will be able to notice the smallest bit of greed, anger, or delusion trying to sneak in and further our stress and suffering. Although I am mostly not aware, I see the progress and the progression of the mindfulness, ardency, and alertness -- progress towards the end of stress and suffering (*dukkha*).

> As Ajaan Lee says, it’s like learning how to grow food on your own property rather than invading the property of others to plant crops on their land. Learn how to develop a sense of ease, a sense of fullness and refreshment right here in the body. Make that your food. Try to preserve and protect that level of the mind. That’s the skill in how you look at things and listen to things: maintaining this sense of the center in the body, a sense of ease, refreshment, and fullness no matter what happens outside. That puts the mind on a higher plane—and in a much better position.
> When you handle restraint of the senses in this way, you’re not depriving the mind. You’re simply learning how to give the mind better food, to nourish it in a healthier way, a way that’s totally blameless. 


> What this comes down to is that, as the Buddha said, even something as simple as looking or listening can be developed as a skill. You look and listen while at the same time trying to maintain your sense of being centered inside. This is one of the best measurements for how much greed, anger, or delusion is lurking in the mind and pushing it around. If you catch the mind flowing out to a particular object, there you are: You’ve found a defilement.
> Many of us in the West don’t like the word “defilement.” We deny that there’s anything defiled in our minds and yet, when the mind is clouded by desire, narrowed by desire, that’s precisely what the Buddha means. Your sense of inner awareness gets obscured and narrowed as your attention goes flowing out. According to Ajaan Lee, the tendency to flow out to things is the meaning of asava: effluent or fermentation. That kind of looking and listening—the kind where your mind flows out to the object—is unskillful looking, unskillful listening. If you’re skillful, you can stay inside while you see and hear. When you catch the mind in the course of flowing out, you’ve learned an important lesson: that there’s still greed, anger, and delusion in the mind. If you want to look for it, here it is. Only when you see it can you actually do something about it. You begin to sense the danger of falling for those currents. You develop the motivation to want to do something about it, so that you don’t have to get pushed around like this any more. You find ways of stopping the flow at its source.




Thanissaro ends with a wonderful exposition of the place of restraint in the practice and how it develops the mind. I can neither summarize it nor add to it, so I would highly encorage those that had read this far to go and read the talk [^2]
